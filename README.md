randomhost/steamsignature
=========================

This package reads the API and XML feeds of Valve's Steam platform and displays
the current online status of players as PNG image, designed to be used in forum
and blog signatures.

The included redirect function detects whether the player is currently playing
on a multiplayer server and either redirects visitors clicking the signature
image to the player's steam profile or turns into a join link which will connect
directly to the multiplayer server if Steam is running on the visitors system.

Usage
-----

The `randomhost/steamsignature` package API is currently in the process of being
written. A usage example will follow once the API is considered stable enough.
